            <p>The NextUp Initiative for the iHeartPodcast Network is a new program that will put creators from all
              backgrounds, including members of historically underrepresented groups, in a five month long podcasting
              bootcamp. There will be a two week
              orientation from August 9th to August 20th, different iHeart employees will guide you through the basic
              steps of creating, editing, marketing, and launching a podcast. </p>
            <p>This unique program will provide creators with an opportunity to learn from
              the best in the industry, and develop a podcast centered around their distinct voice. By the end of the
              program we will expect the participant to have a minimum of three completed podcast episodes and a pitch
              for their show. They will be
              given
              the opportunity to pitch the show to a panel of iHeartPodcast Network development executives with the
              chance of having their show picked up by the network.&nbsp; </p>
